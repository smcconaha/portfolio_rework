                What is something you wish you could do but currently do not have the coding skills to accomplish?
              </strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                For now I would really like to be able to create a nice looking website from scratch. I know I can make something 
                now but it isn't visually appealing. There are so many components and currently I don't have "the eye" or possess 
                the abilities to create something stylish. However, I am hopeful that I can develope those skills in time.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>
                What are you struggling with?
              </strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                I am really struggling with the amount of time required to cover the material. I write detailed notes and it is 
                sometimes hard for me to differentiate the important material from the material that will come in time. I am sure 
                that quality compounds the problem.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>
                How do you solve a problem?
              </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                When it comes to problem solving, I like to fully understand the issue before I go into fix mode. A good example is 
                if I am working on a car I don't just grab a wrench and go to town. I will do a test drive, visual inspection, 
                and/or pull out some sort of diagnostic tool before starting work. I look at most other problems the same way, 
                figure out what is wrong and then come up with a plan to repair or replace it. I am also probably slower than most, 
                but I am methodical and walk away knowing it was done correctly.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>
                What methods do you use to help yourself get unstuck?
              </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                I am stubborn and when it comes to getting stuck I have been known to rack my brain for far too long before changing 
                my strategy. Often I find it best to walk away from the issue and clear my head. Sometimes I can come up with creative
                 solutions or at least reduce the emotional charge. I also like to see how other people have solved similar situations 
                 and that can mean talking with someone about being stuck.

              <strong>
                What are your thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and JavaScript play in the process of rendering content and 
                providing user experience?
              </strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                It is interesting to see the interaction between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. A good comparison would be the Ford 
                Model-T, which originally was a no frills transportation method that only came in one color, black. Then Ford 
                started to focus on appearance by offering body and interior color options as well as appearance trim packages. 
                So now you can get from point A to B in style but what about air conditioning, self dimming headlights, windshield 
                washers? Those came down the line and that functionality became important for auto manufacturers to consider if they
                wanted to stay in business.
                HTML is that bare-bones structure that can likely get you where you need to go on it's own, but we can add style 
                with CSS and make it more attractive. That is a great place to be in but then JavaScript takes it a step further 
                by allowing you to add functionality. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript all play an integral role in the user experience.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>What are some objects that your blog incorporates?</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                I would consider the header and body of each blog to be individual objects or on a larger scale, the pages 
                (i.e., index, weekone, weektwo, and this file). I can imagine writing script for these items in order to add depth.
                I suppose I could also think in terms of some of subjects like, my favorite things. So an example would be:
                <pre><code>
     
                </code></pre>
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>What are your thoughts on pseudocoding?</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                I used to wondered how someone could convert an idea or even a customer requirement into code. It always seemed 
                like such an intimidating process, but now I can see a little more clearly with pseudocode. I can see value in the 
                process and look forward to learning better techniques.

              <strong>
                What was helpful during Onboarding working remotely?
              </strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                The thing I found most useful was the daily stand-ups. When I first learned that we were doing stand-ups, I had 
                flashbacks of my previous job where we had daily stand-ups while working remotely. Honestly, I had a bit of a bad taste 
                in my mouth prior to this because it felt more like the boss checking in on everyone.
                I was glad to see that these stand-ups where different and that we had a platform to discuss our challenges and things 
                that we learned. Stand-ups were beneficial and forever changed my way of thinking.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>What hindered your progress during Onboarding?</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                The thing that hindered me the most is my study methods. I have a difficult time understanding what is important in 
                the material or to be more specific, it all seems important. So I end up taking notes on every little thing, writing 
                exampled, and then playing with the code (if applicable). It definitely concerns me that on most weeks I put in 
                around 50-60 hours on the material. Another thing that hindered me was differentiating a challenge from a blocker 
                and knowing when to walk away. Thirty minutes of failing to understand the issue could result in hours spent trying 
                to figure out what I am doing wrong. That certainly rang true this week and I am hopeful that I can overcome this 
                issue in person.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>How did you overcome challenges during Onboarding?</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                If the challenge was material related I would typically look up additional resources or sometimes it was nice to 
                watch a video explanation. That being said, there were definitely times when I should have leaned more heavily on 
                the help channel. I also felt some of the challenges associated with imposter syndrome. When those thoughts occur 
                I would usually try to refocus with medidation or mindfulness and then think about the person I would be after the 
                program. One of my favorite authors, Thich Nhat Hanh, has a book called No Mud, No Lotus: The Art of Transforming 
                Suffering and I drew a lot of wisdom from that. Essentially, through mindfulness we can embrace difficulties, 
                realize they are temporary, and come out the other side stronger.

              <strong>
                What is the number one thing that held you back this week? Why?
              </strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                The thing that held me back the most this week was probably the bootstrap material. I understood the concept of 
                having columns nested inside of rows which are then nested inside of a container; however, manipulating those 
                elements is difficult for me. As a result, anything requiring bootstrap took me much longer to complete even the 
                most basic change. I have been asking myself why this is the case and I believe there are a few reasons. First, it 
                is a new tool that I have never used and second, I had difficulty navigating W3 Schools and Bootstrap webpages to 
                find what I was attempting to do. I hope to revisit these concepts over the weekend and maybe even find new 
                resources.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>What is one thing you would like to learn more about regarding JavaScript (JSON, Data Structures), Bootstrap, 
                or Atomic Design?</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                I would like to have a better understanding of when it is appropriate to define a method as a key: value pair within 
                an object. I don't fully understand the reason for doing this yet. This is one of many things that I plan to research 
                further when time allows.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>How does In-Person Bootcamp compare to Remote Onboarding?</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                I was concerned that the in-person leg of this journey would be difficult for many reasons. Though I was 
                surprised how I felt at the end of the first in-person week. Working in-person took away some of the anxiety 
                I feel about asking for help or admitting that I don't understand the material. Another major difference is the 
                connections that I have developed that otherwise wouldn't have been possible working remotely. I feel like I am 
                officially part of something and there is a real sense of community and friendship.
            </p>

              <strong>
                What is your “Why”?
              </strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                The reason why I do this is for myself and my family. Previously I had a stable job that paid well and had good 
                benefits; however, I was not happy. Realizing that my struggles were impacting my family was a tough pill to 
                swallow, but I eventually came to the conclusion that I could make a change. I look forward to seeing what I will 
                accomplish in this bootcamp and the person that emerges on the other side.

              <strong>
                What did you learn about that helped you understand the development process?
              </strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                This week I learned about the interactions between websites and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). 
                Chris Hoffman wrote an article on howtogeek titled "What is an API?", that explained in simple terms the usefulness 
                of APIs. I had never considered the amount of work that developers would be responsible for if they could not rely 
                on APIs.

              <strong>What does it mean to develop good code?</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                Developing good code means providing a well-thought-out solution that is both flexible and abstract in a way that 
                allows it to be useful in the future. This is opposed to code that is rigid, difficult to maintain, and/or code 
                that has limited potential.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>What does it mean to be a good developer?</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                Being a good developer means laying out a detailed plan for how you will accomplish the end user's needs while being 
                mindful of project scope. It means writing good code that is legible and well-thought-out as mentioned in above. 
                Another key to being a good developer is continuously honing your skills in order to stay relevant in a rapidly 
                evolving industry.

              <strong>
                What is one thing that programmers hate doing?
              </strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                This is a difficult question to answer because I do not feel like I have earned the title of programmer. However, 
                on multiple occasions I have witnessed creative and talented individuals being dialed back to providing a solution 
                that barely meets the requirements due to budgetary concerns or timeline. I imagine that programmers hate being put 
                in this type of situation and being forced to limit product quality.
                I feel like this is something I can relate to right now because I want to provide solution "X" but only have time 
                to provide solution "Y". Timeline is still a major concern but instead of a monetary budget I am restricted by my 
                knowledge base and mental fortitude.
